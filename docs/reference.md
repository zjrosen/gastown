# Gas Town Reference

Technical reference for Gas Town internals. Read the README first.

## Directory Structure

```
~/gt/                           Town root
├── .beads/                     Town-level beads (hq-* prefix)
├── mayor/                      Mayor config
│   └── town.json
└── <rig>/                      Project container (NOT a git clone)
    ├── config.json             Rig identity
    ├── .beads/ → mayor/rig/.beads
    ├── .repo.git/              Bare repo (shared by worktrees)
    ├── mayor/rig/              Mayor's clone (canonical beads)
    ├── refinery/rig/           Worktree on main
    ├── witness/                No clone (monitors only)
    ├── crew/<name>/            Human workspaces
    └── polecats/<name>/        Worker worktrees
```

**Key points:**
- Rig root is a container, not a clone
- `.repo.git/` is bare - refinery and polecats are worktrees
- Mayor clone holds canonical `.beads/`, others inherit via redirect

## Beads Routing

Gas Town routes beads commands based on issue ID prefix. You don't need to think
about which database to use - just use the issue ID.

```bash
bd show gt-xyz    # Routes to gastown rig's beads
bd show hq-abc    # Routes to town-level beads
bd show wyv-123   # Routes to wyvern rig's beads
```

**How it works**: Routes are defined in `~/gt/.beads/routes.jsonl`. Each rig's
prefix maps to its beads location (the mayor's clone in that rig).

| Prefix | Routes To | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `hq-*` | `~/gt/.beads/` | Mayor mail, cross-rig coordination |
| `gt-*` | `~/gt/gastown/mayor/rig/.beads/` | Gastown project issues |
| `wyv-*` | `~/gt/wyvern/mayor/rig/.beads/` | Wyvern project issues |

Debug routing: `BD_DEBUG_ROUTING=1 bd show <id>`

## Configuration

### Rig Config (`config.json`)
```json
{
  "type": "rig",
  "name": "myproject",
  "git_url": "https://github.com/...",
  "beads": { "prefix": "mp" }
}
```

### Settings (`settings/config.json`)
```json
{
  "theme": "desert",
  "max_workers": 5,
  "merge_queue": { "enabled": true }
}
```

### Runtime (`.runtime/` - gitignored)
Process state, PIDs, ephemeral data.

## Formula Format

```toml
formula = "name"
type = "workflow"           # workflow | expansion | aspect
version = 1
description = "..."

[vars.feature]
description = "..."
required = true

[[steps]]
id = "step-id"
title = "{{feature}}"
description = "..."
needs = ["other-step"]      # Dependencies
```

**Composition:**
```toml
extends = ["base-formula"]

[compose]
aspects = ["cross-cutting"]

[[compose.expand]]
target = "step-id"
with = "macro-formula"
```

## Molecule Lifecycle

```
Formula (source TOML) ─── "Ice-9"
    │
    ▼ bd cook
Protomolecule (frozen template) ─── Solid
    │
    ├─▶ bd mol pour ──▶ Mol (persistent) ─── Liquid ──▶ bd squash ──▶ Digest
    │
    └─▶ bd mol wisp ──▶ Wisp (ephemeral) ─── Vapor ──┬▶ bd squash ──▶ Digest
                                                  └▶ bd burn ──▶ (gone)
```

**Note**: Wisps are stored in `.beads/` with an ephemeral flag - they're not
persisted to JSONL. They exist only in memory during execution.

## Molecule Commands

**Principle**: `bd` = beads data operations, `gt` = agent operations.

### Beads Operations (bd)

```bash
# Formulas
bd formula list              # Available formulas
bd formula show <name>       # Formula details
bd cook <formula>            # Formula → Proto

# Molecules (data operations)
bd mol list                  # Available protos
bd mol show <id>             # Proto details
bd mol pour <proto>          # Create mol
bd mol wisp <proto>          # Create wisp
bd mol bond <proto> <parent> # Attach to existing mol
bd mol squash <id>           # Condense to digest (explicit ID)
bd mol burn <id>             # Discard wisp (explicit ID)
```

### Agent Operations (gt)

```bash
# Hook management (operates on current agent's hook)
gt mol status                # What's on MY hook
gt mol current               # What should I work on next
gt mol progress <id>         # Execution progress of molecule
gt mol attach <bead> <mol>   # Pin molecule to bead
gt mol detach <bead>         # Unpin molecule from bead
gt mol attach-from-mail <id> # Attach from mail message

# Agent lifecycle (operates on agent's attached molecule)
gt mol burn                  # Burn attached molecule (no ID needed)
gt mol squash                # Squash attached molecule (no ID needed)
gt mol step done <step>      # Complete a molecule step
```

**Key distinction**: `bd mol burn/squash <id>` take explicit molecule IDs.
`gt mol burn/squash` operate on the current agent's attached molecule
(auto-detected from working directory).

## Agent Lifecycle

### Polecat Shutdown
```
1. Complete work steps
2. bd mol squash (create digest)
3. Submit to merge queue
4. gt handoff (request shutdown)
5. Wait for Witness to kill session
6. Witness removes worktree + branch
```

### Session Cycling
```
1. Agent notices context filling
2. gt handoff (sends mail to self)
3. Manager kills session
4. Manager starts new session
5. New session reads handoff mail
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BEADS_DIR` | Point to shared beads database |
| `BEADS_NO_DAEMON` | Required for worktree polecats |
| `GT_TOWN_ROOT` | Override town root detection |

## CLI Reference

### Town Management
```bash
gt install [path]            # Create town
gt install --git             # With git init
gt doctor                    # Health check
gt doctor --fix              # Auto-repair
```

### Rig Management
```bash
gt rig add <name> --remote=<url>
gt rig list
gt rig remove <name>
```

### Work Assignment
```bash
gt sling <bead> <rig>        # Assign to polecat
gt sling <bead> <rig> --molecule=<proto>
```

### Communication
```bash
gt mail inbox
gt mail read <id>
gt mail send <addr> -s "Subject" -m "Body"
gt mail send --human -s "..."    # To overseer
```

### Escalation
```bash
gt escalate "topic"              # Default: MEDIUM severity
gt escalate -s CRITICAL "msg"    # Urgent, immediate attention
gt escalate -s HIGH "msg"        # Important blocker
gt escalate -s MEDIUM "msg" -m "Details..."
```

See [escalation.md](escalation.md) for full protocol.

### Sessions
```bash
gt handoff                   # Request cycle (context-aware)
gt handoff --shutdown        # Terminate (polecats)
gt session stop <rig>/<agent>
gt peek <agent>              # Check health
gt nudge <agent> "message"   # Send message to agent
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always use `gt nudge` to send messages to Claude sessions.
Never use raw `tmux send-keys` - it doesn't handle Claude's input correctly.
`gt nudge` uses literal mode + debounce + separate Enter for reliable delivery.

### Emergency
```bash
gt stop --all                # Kill all sessions
gt stop --rig <name>         # Kill rig sessions
```

## Beads Commands (bd)

```bash
bd ready                     # Work with no blockers
bd list --status=open
bd list --status=in_progress
bd show <id>
bd create --title="..." --type=task
bd update <id> --status=in_progress
bd close <id>
bd dep add <child> <parent>  # child depends on parent
bd sync                      # Push/pull changes
```

## Patrol Agents

Deacon, Witness, and Refinery run continuous patrol loops using wisps:

| Agent | Patrol Molecule | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Deacon** | `mol-deacon-patrol` | Agent lifecycle, plugin execution, health checks |
| **Witness** | `mol-witness-patrol` | Monitor polecats, nudge stuck workers |
| **Refinery** | `mol-refinery-patrol` | Process merge queue, review PRs |

```
1. bd mol wisp mol-<role>-patrol
2. Execute steps (check workers, process queue, run plugins)
3. bd mol squash (or burn if routine)
4. Loop
```

## Plugin Molecules

Plugins are molecules with specific labels:

```json
{
  "id": "mol-security-scan",
  "labels": ["template", "plugin", "witness", "tier:haiku"]
}
```

Patrol molecules bond plugins dynamically:
```bash
bd mol bond mol-security-scan $PATROL_ID --var scope="$SCOPE"
```

## Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Agent in wrong directory | Check cwd, `gt doctor` |
| Beads prefix mismatch | Check `bd show` vs rig config |
| Worktree conflicts | Ensure `BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1` for polecats |
| Stuck worker | `gt nudge`, then `gt peek` |
| Dirty git state | Commit or discard, then `gt handoff` |

## Architecture Notes

**Bare repo pattern**: `.repo.git/` is bare (no working dir). Refinery and polecats are worktrees sharing refs. Polecat branches visible to refinery immediately.

**Beads as control plane**: No separate orchestrator. Molecule steps ARE beads issues. State transitions are git commits.

**Nondeterministic idempotence**: Any worker can continue any molecule. Steps are atomic checkpoints in beads.
